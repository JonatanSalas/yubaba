# Reveal

Will reveal a container around a marked focal element using `width` and `height`,
or alternatively `clip-path`.

This component requires the use of a [FocalTarget](/focal-target) to mark the focal element.

## Usage

```js
import { Reveal } from 'yubaba';
```

## Props

<PropsTable of={Reveal} />
