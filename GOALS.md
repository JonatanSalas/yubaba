# goals

- Be modular. Have a base library that does the calculations and dom manipulations and light-weight wrapper libraries.
- Support delayed transitions i.e. there are three states. START -> WAIT -> FINISH.
- Contain various "out-of-the-box" transitions (material).
- Support "limitless" custom transitions/overrides.
- Thoughts about creating for a particular router + ui? (IF WAIT STATE).
- Support "simple" list item -> page relationships.
