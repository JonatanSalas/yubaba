## Why yubaba

`yubaba` is as much of a _platform_ as it is an **orchestrator**.
It comes with prebuilt animations you can drop in and start using immediately,
such as [ConcealMove](https://yubabajs.com/conceal-move) and [RevealMove](https://yubabajs.com/reveal-move) which together can [create an awesome user experience](https://yubabajs.com/advanced-usage) seen above!

But even better you can create [_custom_ animations](https://yubabajs.com/custom-animations)!
Using the same internals the [prebuilt animations use](https://yubabajs.com/getting-started),
it comes with a first class customization experience for you to do,
well,
anything!
